        <h2>A day in my life.</h2>

        <p id="content"> First off, my day began at 12 am as I stayed up talking to my roomates until 3 am. We were watching videos and asking eachother questions about random things. Eventually I went to bed, sadly the cleaning lady woke me up at around ten. At least my bathroom was clean when I woke up though. I went to class at around 12, I had a lab for my textiles class. We burned fibers which was intresting, and I also got some yarn to practice weaving my own tapestry. I went to the bookstore after my lab to get some packages, and I ended up getting a few other things as well. I went back to my dorm and worked on homework until my web design class started. After that I made some ramen noodles, called my mom to wish her happy birthday, and worked on homework.</p>
        <h2>Clothing haul.</h2>

        <p id="content">I went to the bookstore today to pick up three packages that I got in the mail. I got two fromTtarget and one from American Eagle. On the way out of the bookstore I saw a clearance rack that I had to stop at. I ended up getting a cheetah print NDSU sweater and a NDSU sports bra. From Target I got a white, tie-back workout tank top, navy leggings, some light brown overalls, and a brown turtleneck. From American Eagle I got some brown leggings and some orange leggings. I am going to return both the orange and navy leggings as they did not fit amazingly well. </p>
